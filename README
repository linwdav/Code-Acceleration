INSTRUCTIONS
=============================================================================
Compile the program with "make"

Run with "./run".  This will output three files:
	GHZ_output.txt
	profiler_output.txt
	execution_time.txt

Verify calculation by running "diff GHZ_original_output.txt GHZ_output.txt"

Open profiler_output.txt to see how the program spent its time in execution

Open execution_time.txt to see how long the entire program took to run


NOTES
